FROM MILETUS:  Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes -- stuff is made of single substance: water!  vapor!

Parmenides - nothing changes
Heraclitus - everything flows
- source of everything:  God or Logos
Empedocles - Resolution:  basic elements don't change, but since water cannot turn into a butterfly, there must be more than one kind of element.
- separated elements and forces

Anaxagoras - nature built from infinite number of minute particles
- everything in everything.  since things dont change there must be skin and bone in milk
