So yes, again, I'm happy to acknowledge that there are issues with immigration ... a grain of truth ... problem is, there’s a beach-worth of other issues that the MAGA faithful ignores.
... I'm genuinely not sure how to speak to that cohort of people.


I can give a suggestion on speaking to that cohort -- you cannot gaslight their pet issue, even if you know it to be smaller than more important ones.  And this is not a problem centered on you.  It is a broader problem with the language of the left.  It is too F*** smug... too ready to just "write those morons off" as un-convertable.  They were converted into these beliefs and if society is to survive they need to be converted out.

But first we have to LISTEN.  We cannot note that part of a person's thinking is racist and simply shut down.  The truth is, in many of these cases (dozens of people I know personally in red states), racism does not feel to be the center of their motivation.  It is an (incorrect) belief that the left is selling the nation down the river, and that the left is too focused on tiny things (like trans rights for gov-paid surgery or such)

Of course, they have been propagandized.  The solution, I believe, is to acknowledge the grains of truth in their position charitably, then propose a more limited liberal position that addresses the grain of truth.  THEN you can end by pointing to a larger, more important issue.  But the left (and you in this case) are shutting down when 'illegal' thinking like racism is involved -- this is a mistake I think.

One needs to address the speck in one's eye, before trying to clear the plank in one's brother's eye.
(Yes, I know I intentionally reversed the biblical verse here.)
