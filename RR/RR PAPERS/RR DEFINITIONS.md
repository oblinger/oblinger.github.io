Schelling point
-?- 
Named after the economist Thomas Schelling, is a concept from game theory that refers to a solution or strategy that people naturally tend to choose in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or salient to all parties involved.
Key Characteristics:
1. **Focal Point**: It is a prominent solution that stands out as an obvious choice for all participants.
2. **Coordination Without Communication**: Schelling points allow individuals to coordinate their actions with others without explicit agreement or communication.
3. **Context-Dependent**: The prominence or salience of a Schelling point depends on the specific context and shared cultural or situational understanding.
