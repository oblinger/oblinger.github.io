- Coursera DL C3 - Notes and review
- Learn about SV system
- clang check it out.  maybe use it
- Try Codium, Cursor, GPT alternative
- [Andrej Karpathy releases new 3 hour video](https://link.alphasignal.ai/q4NAum) explaining LLM training stack discussing topics like Llama 3.1 examples, Hallucinations, and RLHF.
-  [Learn how to scale LLMs on TPUs](https://link.alphasignal.ai/EBzeFt), optimize parallelism, and efficiently manage training and inference.
A strong understanding of probability distributions, Bayes' theorem, hypothesis testing, MLE, MAP, and basic causal inference (this might need to go up depending on your job).


# TODO
- [[RR PAPERS]]: Read '!' papers in my list.
- Coursera Ng Course complete (along w/ Transformers discussion)


# Ideas. [[RR PAPERS]] 
- okrs
- [[RR OKRs]] - 

### Ideas
llms. more then generative
pytortch
skills. fast moving. ml research.  
post grad researchers summaries on papers
practitioners blogs
cost landscape changing hiring
