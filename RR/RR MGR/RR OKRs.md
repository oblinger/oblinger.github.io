**OKR RULES**: (From [Mooncamp](https://mooncamp.com/okr/))
- Company Mission -> Objectives -> Key Results -> Initiatives
- **Mission** - Central, Timeless, Inspirational
- **Objective** - Ambitious, Qualitative, Easy to understand, Inspiring, Memorable
- **Key Result** - [[S.M.A.R.T]] + Verifiable.  (Aspirational / Stretch vs Committed)
- **Initiatives** - (Key Actions) to achieve key result.  (not used by all)
- 2-4 Key-Results for 2-4 Objectives
- John Doerr @ Google: Max 5 KR for 4 Objectives
- Should be somewhat aspirational
- NOT a tool for performance evaluation -- they get gamed!
- *OUTCOME DRIVEN* - not todo list of actions!
- CORRECT LAG/LEAD MEASURE - leading enough to influence it in period.
- SOURCE - 40% from the top, 60% from the bottom.
- CYCLE:  Planning -> Weekly Tracking -> End Review -> End Retro
- METRICS preferred over MILESTONES
- OKR == KPI + target.
- MBO - Management by Objectives == older, annual, only objectives part, private, compensation
- CREATION:  We will _ _ _ _ _ as measured by _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .
- SCORING:  RED 0-30% Y 40-60% G 70%-100%
- TARGET:  60-70% average
- ESCALATION: Fast when committed one at risk
