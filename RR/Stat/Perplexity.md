Perplexity;;measures the average number of choices the model has for predicting the next word (entropy of next word prediction) <!--SR:!2025-06-10,81,270-->

Perplexity Formula
-?-
Perplexity =  2^{H(p)}.  where H(p) is the entropy of the probability distribution \( p \), which can be computed as:
H(p) = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log_2 p(x_i) <!--SR:!2025-05-06,76,270-->

Here, \( N \) is the number of words or tokens in the sequence, and \( p(x_i) \) is the probability of the \( i \)-th word or token predicted by the model.

In deep learning, particularly in natural language processing, perplexity is a measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. It essentially quantifies how uncertain the model is about the next word in a sequence.

A lower perplexity indicates that the model is more confident and accurate in predicting the next word, while a higher perplexity means the model is less confident and makes less accurate predictions. In other words, perplexity measures the average number of choices the model has for predicting the next word, with lower values reflecting better performance.
