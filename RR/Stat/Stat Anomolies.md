Stat Anomalies

***** Simpsons Paradox
- Treatment A is better on small stones, and large stones.  but when considered together treatment B is better
  Happens when outcome variable general value is higher for the subgroup where more B treatments were tested.
  (this can only happen w. a confounding variable, e.g.  when the choice to use treatment B is tied to subgroup)

examples of each subgroup is different

***** Issues w. the P-test

(1) Data dredging     -- when looking at many null hypotheses then only reporting on the signficant ones
(2) Effect size       -- the P-value may be very strong, even when the underlying effect is very small.   (e.g. only a .000001% change can still have an arbitrarily small P value)
(3) Ignoring priors   -- P-value does not consider prior knowledge about the effect
