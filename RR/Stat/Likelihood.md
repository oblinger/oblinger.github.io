PROBABILITY - The chances of some data GIVEN a particular model:   P( d | m )
LIKELIHOOD - The changes of some model (and model parameters) GIVEN some data:  L( m | d )

-   Probabilities are the areas under a **fixed** distribution. Mathematically denoted by: p( data | distribution )
-   Likelihoods are the y-axis values for fixed data points with different distributions. Mathematically denoted by: L( distribution | data )
