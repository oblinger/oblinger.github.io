Logistic Regression
-?-
... taking log does not affect where min and max are found.

Logistic Function
-?-
- Logistic Function = sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-z)
- Inverse of the Logit Function
- Maps (-INF,INF) -> (0, 1)

Logit Function
-?-
- logit(p) = log(p / 1-p).    # the log-odds of an event p happening
- The inverse of the sigmoid function
- It transforms a probability p (0, 1) --> (-inf, +inf)
- The logit function, also known as the logistic function, 
- It's commonly used in logistic regression.
- x = logit(sigmoid(x))
