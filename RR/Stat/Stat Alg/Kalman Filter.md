Kalman filter as a two stage filter: (1) prediction and (2)
correction
1. Understand the difference between motion and measurement models
2. Use the Kalman filter in a simple 1D localization example



Filter updates estimate of the state of a system.

ALG:
- State is represented as a statistical model
- Next state is predicted 
- Optimally fuse predicted state and observations to predict new estimated state.


**THEORETICAL RESULT** - Kalman Filters are BLUE
**BLUE** - (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator)
**BIAS** - Average error in estimator.  (unbiased means zero bias)
**CONSISTENT** - An estimator is neither under or over confident of its estimate.  Its correlation matrix matches the observed correlation matrix.
