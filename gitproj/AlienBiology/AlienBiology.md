Many existing large language model tests are suseptible to training set taint and are not designed to test the very long interaction chains expected with Agentic AI.  Alien Biology aim to address these concerns:


**Alien Biology**:
1. Is based entirely on a ***synthetically-generated*** &nbsp; "alien" biology, including a newly invented chemistry.
2. It ***avoids training-set taint*** since it is derived from an alien universe.
3. Its multi-level novel structures and functions provide a complex testbed ideal for assessing agentic AIs' ability to compete with ***extended human-level reasoning*** over hours, days, weeks, or years.
4. It is generative, thus ***facilitating very fine-grained measurements*** of agentic performance improvement.

## Artifacts relevant for Alien Biology construction
Below are some samples from the data artifacts being used as the statistical basis for the Alien Biology generator.

**[Example Reactions](/gitproj/AlienBiology/CellReactions.pdf)**. The Alien Biology generator is based on terrestrial Cell Biology statistics.  Below is a sample list of chemical reactions central to Cell Biology.  Each entry indicates the reactants, products, and catalysts for the reaction.    [Example Reactions](/gitproj/AlienBiology/CellReactions.pdf)

**Biological Processes**.  Executable examples of terrestrial behavior processes.  Examples of energy transport processes, anabolic and catabolic behavioral systems, used as a statistical basis for corresponding alien processes:
- [Photosynthesis](/gitproj/AlienBiology/Photosynthesis.pdf) 
- [5 Interrelated Cell Respiration Processes](/gitproj/AlienBiology/CellMetabolism5.pdf)
