description: "Claim: The fraction of machine-interpretable information will grow to eclipse human-interpretable communications.  This will be true both in terms of the importance of the communication and as a percentage of total volume.  It will also hold between and within intelligent agents."

This shift will occur across four areas:
- Corporate IP will shift towards 
- Secret IP
- Corp to corp IP
- Financial IP


Machine Interpretable
- Better for keeping secrets
- More precise for encoding info
- Supports much much higher volume/complexity
- Legally more efficient
- Financially more efficient



Machine Interpretable communications are digital messages that are interpretable by AI systems, but are pragmatically difficult or impossible for humans to process.
- AI-systems are capable of processing orders of magnitude more information that humans, thus the sheer volume of information within a message may make it impractical for humans to process them.
- AI-systems also excel at interpreting information where its constituent terms are all formally defined.  Humans can struggle with mapping many terms having complex formal meanings.

Human Interpretable communications are just the opposite:
- They must involve shorter messages with less material to interpret
- And they are able to handle poorly defined terms
