title: Loop Closing
description: 'Claim: Both scale and cost will jump discontinuously each time AI "closes loop" over all aspects of an end-to-end business function.'

**Definition**:
We define ***loop closing*** as the automation of an end-to-end business activity so that humans are no longer used in any aspect of the process. Instead, it is fully automated via an AI-based solution.

**Thesis #1**:
AI is progressing to a point where it will match or surpass human performance on enough tasks within an increasing range of human-performed jobs so as to "close the loop" on those jobs.

**Thesis #2**:
Once loop is closed over an entire job function, performance on that job function will jump discontinuously in cost and productivity.

**Thesis**:
As AI-ability surpasses human-ability across ALL aspects of a given job, AI will tend to "close loop" such in a way that humans are not involved-in or even aware-of the actions the AI is taking in execution of this ability.

**Justification**:
- Because of [[Natural_Selection]], each time AI-abilities surpass human-ability, execution of that ability is aggressively transitioned to AI-execution.
-  that specific 

**Discussion**:

Quickly there will become no comparison between open-loop and closed-loop performance on tasks that have closed.
