- there will be police bots
- will have mandated powers of investigation
- probably can be made non-agentic so its own agency is strongly managed.
	- might work

- companies will explicitly train and direct their agents to skirt the edges of the police when they can get away with it, and to seek vulnerabilities in the monitoring

- Includes other corporations, governments, societal bodies, individuals, members of ones own corporation, other AIs serving each of these groups.

Deliberate management of extra-agental understandings towards realities that achieve desired outcomes is accepted standard business practice.  We will (and do) design our computional systems to mirror this essential and expected business practice.

We even apply these practices against members of our own organization.

- Organizations spawned from these convergent goals will have:
	- Agendas
	- Goal-setting discussions
	- Sophisticated shared and withheld reasoning about extra-agentic actions/goals/consequences



Specifically, these agents will be deeply involved in discussions about how various human, governmental, and corporate groups will react and behave based on actions members of the group might take.
