title: Profit --> Power --> Control
description: "Claim: In a competitive marketplace, increasing profits tends to translate into increasing power, which tends to translate into increasing control over others."

In a multi-party system, increasing profits for a single party may not result in outsized control over others if the total of all other parties still outweighs that of the individual. But as the profits of a single party (or an aligned group of parties) start to dominate all other parties combined, its power and control will also tend to dominate them as well.
