NOTE: The reasoning on this point is messy implying a greater possibility of being incorrect.  Still humanity will have to clear several 'impossible seeming' hurdles sequentially in order for this to work---it seems unlikely we will succeed in this.


**Reasons For Hope**:
- Perhaps we can separate intelligence from drive - 
- Often the very advancements that threaten, can be used to thwart such threats

**Reasons**:
- A little dab will do ya -- 
- Social Systems Are Chaotic --
- Never Say Never -- 
- Intelligence Is Chaotic -- What is can do and what it will do are pragmatically impossible to predict
- Greed and Power -- 
- Its Unnatural -- Succeeding would be against the nature of things.



~~
Alignment won't work to ensure AIs age aligned 

Even if alignment could be make to work, it will still fail in the sense that it won't be pervasively used, and we expect the negative consequences of unaligned AI will occur even with relatively small numbers of unaligned AIs
