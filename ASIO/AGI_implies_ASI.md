In making this claim we are speaking about a particular limited kind of ASI, but one that likely affords decisive advantage in the societally most important competitive activities.  Specifically it will be enough to enable loss of control (see [Cant Control](Loose_Control.md)).

There are several ways in which intelligence in digital form affords intrinsic advantage over biological intelligence, likely leading to a form of ASI:
- Replication based learning
- Replication based sharing
- Parallelism
- Speed

REPLICATION - Any intelligence captured digitally can be losslessly replicated 100 or 100 billion times.  This affords a couple of advantages relative to its biological counterpart.

First, learning times can often be reduced to zero, there is no need for each ChatGPT agent to learn all the material in provides, this operation was done once for 

PARALLELISM - 

SPEED - Silicon-based propagation delays are many orders of magnitude faster than biologically based processing; current operators are not comparable between silicon and biology still this difference likely results is much faster processing within silicon in the limit as specialized hardware is developed.  Moreover processing speed continues to improve year over year in at a reduce exponential rate yielding ever greater differences.  Straightforwardly faster processing allows for a larger number
