TL; DR. As AI systems become information theoretically more complex, it is expected that the task of finding deliberately injected behaviors into those systems will become ever more difficult than the task of hiding those behaviors.  This implies a structural advantage for agents that are tasked with subterfuge relative to agents tasked with detecting this subterfuge.
