The Hard Problem Of Consciousness -- The problem of Qualia

People understand the idea of computing a thing and knowing a thing.
People have a sense that experiencing a thing is more than simply knowing it or it being computed.  It was _experience_, which they perceive to be different than simply it being computed.

If a person's arm were numbed, then broken, they might have detailed knowlege of the situation of their arm, but they did not experience this breaking as they would have w/o the numbing.  Even in the case that all inferences available were the same in both cases, no one would say the qualia was the same.

Explaining this secondary "knowing" of experience is the problem of qualia.
