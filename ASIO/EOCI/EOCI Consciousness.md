CONSCIOUSNESS

Here is my quick summary of consciousness.  It is my leading candidate since by Occam’s razor I should not add anything more than what is needed to explain all observations (including my own SUBJECTIVE observations as well.) I cannot find any observations which this basic framework does not cover well.  I am interested if others can point to things it does not explain.

CONSCIOUS AGENT
A conscious agent is an embodied modelling systems with a model of its own embodiment.  This includes its innate instincts & propensities, as well as its indirect perceptions of the modelling systems perceptual and processing systems.

SUBJECTIVE AWARENESS
Subjective awareness is the mapping of current perceptual inputs into a world abstraction of those inputs.

Thus an ant may have some awareness in so much as it has a world abstraction.  All mammals clearly have awareness, though human's appear to have a much more nuanced model of their own embodiment, thus their subjective awareness is much larger or richer.  (they can fear death in their distant future for example)

BEING CONSCIOUS
And thus an agent is subjectively aware of its own consciousness in moments when it is attending to and processing inputs from multiple levels of the two-leveled model of its own embodiment.

In this way 'being conscious' is not all or nothing.  A conscious agent can operate for stretches of time in an unconscious way, simply reacting to percept without engaging in perception or processing related to the two-level model of self.  We all have that experience of time disappearing when ones mind is aimlessly wandering, or when deep in flow in a well known activity.

By contrast here is an example of an agent being conscious:  Lisa was frustrated this math problem was just not making sense!  Then she recalled she had not eaten all day, noted a sharp hunger pang that had been previously been ignored, and decided to stop for a bite to eat.
She is interacting with this dual leveled model of her embodiment, including perceptions of her thinking and perceiving, as well as models about how her embodiment operates.

In any case, if I am saying I have some expectation that consciousness will likely be there soon, then I need to have some idea of that that thing is!  Below is consciousness in 1/2 page.  It is my leading candidate since by Occam’s razor suggests I should not add anything more than what is needed to explain all observations (including my own SUBJECTIVE observations as well.). I cannot find any observations this basic framework does not cover well. 

  

I am interested if you can point to specific subjective or objective things that don’t fit well with this model.
