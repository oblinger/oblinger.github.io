- Each time an industry gets close to a loop closing capital aggregation drives a swift influx of the capital needed to drive it as fast as practical to completion.
- Only a small number of corporations can amass the capital to keep up with this fierce innovation velocity.
- Those corporations that successfully close loop will being operating at a level dramatically above those who have not.  
- Each industry that has closed loop will shrink down to those that have successfully closed loop.

- It is possible that the human level reasoning sufficient for loop closing across many industries may be achieved in a very short period in the case that a common reasoning component is sufficient for all of them has been developed by one or a couple corporations.

- Even in this case, the result will still be multiple corporations covering disparate industries.
- AGI by itself will not be sufficient for closing loop within an industry.  Business contracts, industry assets, etc. will be owned by existing players, and will need to be combined with the AGI capability.  
- Existing entities will be in better position for each industry.  These players will tend to be the winners in this race.


- As more an more industries are disrupted by loop closing the will shrink to smaller sets of AGI based winners.
- As the fraction of AGI-based industries grows more and more often such AGI-based corporations will directly negotiate, supply, etc. other AGI-based corporations.we
- The result will web of corporations that looks very much like our current web of corporations except these corporations managed largely by AGI.
