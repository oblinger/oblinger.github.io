To a first order of approximation corporations are capital aggregation mechanisms.  
They tend to select actions that have highest ROI over all other considerations.

Specifically, given multiple available courses of action, corporations tend to select those that appear to offer notably higher returns on investment.
When the difference is significant, this consideration tends to override all other considerations.  

Indeed in some cases, individuals and organizations will go to great lengths in order to justify taking an unethical or deleterious action in order to justify one with higher ROI.
