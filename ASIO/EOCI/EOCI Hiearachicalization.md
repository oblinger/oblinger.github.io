Many agenic aggegators are composites with sub-agents (human or computer) that are constituent parts of the composite agent.

Given the overriding objective held by the aggregator as a whole, it will be important that each sub-agent is also working toward the same overriding goal, and not towards some goal specific for the sub-agent.

The drive will cause the composite to progressively align agent goals when possible.  It is fine if the sub-agents using their autonomy to persue the aggregation goals according to their own knowlege, but it is not ok if these sub-agents are optomising towoard orthogonal or even opposing goals.


INTRIGUE
Given the overriding and singular nature of an agentic aggregator non-alignment or "intrigue" among the sub-agents is an undesirable possibility inherent in multi-agent systems.  With human agents this amounts to building corporate culture and accountability with to ensure alignment.  With computational agents it will likely be possible to clone portions (or all) of the agency of a the central agent
