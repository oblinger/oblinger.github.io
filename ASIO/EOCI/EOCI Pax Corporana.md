## Pax Corporana

**Pax Corporana** - The natural extension of present day trend towards corporate domination greatly accelerated by AI, and increasingly controlled by AI.

Very much like today's progression towards increasing corporate power and control with several differences:
- Today the contextualized strategic model of the entire corporation is best understood by its executives.
  Soon that best understanding will resided in its AI.
- Loop Closing will confer outsize ongoing advantages in each area where they occur.
	- This will spur land-grab races where ever growing asset pools vie to dominate each loop closure as they become possible.
	- Will winnow space to only a couple winners in each area as the rest cannot keep up.
	- Innovation speeds will dramatically increase within closed loop systems
	- The value of human labor relative to the value of these close loop systems will plummet

PAX CORPORANA
- Time period dominated by corporations with a trifecta: 
  1. ASSETS - assets specialized for their mission
  2. NETWORK - network of specialized business relationships, contracts, and brands.
  3. KNOWLEDGE - knowledge specialized for the companies mission.

- The PACS corporana is dominated by these companies each with a prime mission of delivering some critical value to the ecosystem. 
- In healthy ecosystems are our. Our healthy sectors there's four or more. Worldwide participants that collectively manage and control delivery of that capability to the planet. In unhealthy sectors three are fewer. The difference is when you have three or fewer. Then the antagonistic strategies become dominant. And basically killing other participants becomes the dominant strategy. Once you have four or more, the dominant strategy is just simply becoming more efficient at delivering and eating away at the market share of others. Where you basically are frena- with the other competitors in the space. It's win-win that the only way that you take market share is by being more efficient than the other. Nefarious a ways of getting market share cause retaliation and cause both the retaliator and the attacker to lose performance relative to others. Attacking directly doesn't make any sense. 

CORPORATIONS SLOWLY TAKE THE LEAD
- The PACS corporana is actually dominated by a number of sectors that are mostly healthy. So most efforts are actually towards maximizing delivery of output as a function of resource. This actually brings the core. The corporation steadily in greater power than the nation-states. It's true that each corporation is part of a nation-state and thus in some ways is controlled by it. But the profits that drive the nation-state are tied to the profits of each corporation. So there's a zero-sum game where each nation-states... ...becomes increasingly beholden to the corporations within its borders and getting whatever profits it can from those corporations. Thus the world order becomes dominated by corporations rather than nation-states. 

RISE OF INTERLINGUA 
- The rise of interlingua. Increasingly there are sub-specializations, sub-concepts which don't have any natural naming in any human language. Examples include:
	1. The space of all possible ligands in drug discovery generates a number of important named entities which don't have any human language equivalent. 
	2. Similarly, financial products and derivative products that become important in contract negotiations come to be and come to be named in interlingua in ways that don't correspond to human language. 
- Human researchers try to generate an increasing number of words to map onto these most important interlingua concepts. But the race is on and lost to humans where AIs have a vocabulary much in excess to humans and much of their contracts and their inner communication occur in this interlingua, not in human communication. Like an archaeologist, humans are able to dive in and understand specific parts of the interlingua, but taken as a whole, it's far beyond human comprehension to understand interlingua. 
- Indeed, interlingua is so large that it is effectively unused or irrelevant to most AIs as well

FUTURE ARC - Understanding the future as arcs of progression. 
- I hesitate to call it the arc of progress, because progress seems to be aiming towards a specific end goal, and that's not really the nature of the system. That is, that which comes next is really the nature of the system. A key arc of progression is towards an interlingua and towards Pax's corporana, where the winner corporations have an incentive to the world order. An incentive towards domination of the ascendant corporations to service the needs of all of the planet to avoid any new incumbents within their space. 
- Each one of the prime providers of a prime product would imagine the dream of getting a stake in a new product, but these only occur once in a generation that a new product comes into the possibility. Thus, each of the prime providers is mostly locked into a win-win competition with other prime providers. There's really a push against any nation-state interference with their planetary domination of the ecosystem. Anything that breaks this can really create a competitor that could actually rise from zero to become one of the anointed, and that's a definite negative for them. 
- So each one of the prime providers has an imperative that's baked into the structure of the provider itself. It's independent of human will, it's independent of AI will, it is the structure of the system that drives them. Underneath these prime providers are both humans with their own human wills and AIs with their own AI wills, but neither of these actually impact the prime providers and their goals. Their goals are really dictated by economics and economic imperatives. Where they leverage their trifecta in contrast to and in preference to other who have less ability to generate the same outputs from the same trifecta.
