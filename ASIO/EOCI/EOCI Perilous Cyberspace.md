Systems will centrally invest in security self against other AGI systems

Progressively larger fractions of the total command, control, and execution of the agenic aggregators will exist entirely within cyber space.
The risks associated cyber attacks will grow to become existential in nature for the entities.  
And just as today capabilities that afford the strongest forms of cyber defense will afford the same agent the strongest forms of cyber offense.

This condition will inevitably engender a cyber arms race among these agents.

It will also likely lend significant pressure towards regulatory prohibitions against cyber usage and perhaps cyber reserach.  Such regulations will likely be difficult to enact as attributions is difficult, and tracking research will likely be difficult.  Still unlike physical space, cyber space is to some degree more configurable, so it maybe possible to invent platforms the better support the tracking required to allow such regulations to be effective.

Whatever the case, these agents will likely view such attacks as we now view, assault, attempted murder, or war.  The stakes are high, sometimes existential for these agents, thus their focus on the issues will be great.



The cyber world will be typically safer and occasionally more perilous than the physical world.  Good cyber hygiene will limit nearly all attack as over time the interface and substrate parts of the cyber infrastructure gets better and better tested and understood it becomes progressively hard to launch attacks.  In the physical world when a person get assaulted this usually does not result in a change that limits that kind of an assult in the future.  in cyber space often such assults are carried out using some flaw which can be understood and fixed.

But on the other hand the scale of damage possible for increasingly aggregated aggregators grows exponentially, so the possibility of existential damage remains a distinct possibility.  It is as if any enetity in cyber space might have a million nuclear weapons it could potentially unleash.   All will naturally be on edge even if there are few day-to-day attacks are occurring. 


Even as it is mundane and predictable, cyberspace will feel and be perilous.
