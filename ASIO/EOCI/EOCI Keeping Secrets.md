**Thesis**: [[Corp_AI|Corp AI]] will be far better at keeping secrets than employees, thus as [[Loop_Closing|Loop Closing]] occurs [[Natural_Selection|Natural Selection]] pressures will drive organizations to ensure their AI's are the only entities that know their most valuable secrets.


Justification:
- AIs are far better and keeping secrets
	- An AI is owned by a corp in a way that a human employee is not.  
	- Thus it can be controlled in ways that a human employee cannot.
	- Difference is large and pronounced
	- It seems it could keep secrets for many decades.
- Makes knowledge held only by AI's more valuable knowledge.
- Once investors understand this distinction they will value companies with AI-secrets more valuably than others
- Once companies understand this they will insist the usage of AI-secrets whenever possible.
