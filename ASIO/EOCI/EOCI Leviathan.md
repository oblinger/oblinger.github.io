[[EOCI Inevitability Thesis]] 

LEVIATHAN - Planetary-scale organization human + AI organization with a broad but singular focus (typically making money)
- Planetary means: Apex of resources available, scope of assets controlled, size of ascribed mandate

==> why leviathans and not a sea of many?


UNIVERSAL SKILLS
High level performance on these skills are key for the success of all leviathan.
- Mastery of the legal, financial, business, commercial universes that touch upon their business (which includes nearly all business)
- Ability to understand and manipulate all other leviathans as well as lesser entities.
- Ability to understand and manipulate all humans.
- Second order ability to recursively understand and operate among other entities with these same understanding/manipulating skills


LOOP CLOSING
Leviathans synergistically combine strengths of both humans and AIs in everything they do.  Nonetheless there will be a strong pressure to increase the range of activities the leviathan can perform in a closed loop fashion with humans merely reacting to and contributing on summaries of "after action" rollups, rather than as an integral part of these loops.

Otherwise humans will bottleneck the velocity, the volume, and the complexity of the contracts and other actions these systems use to interact with each other and with the world itself.

==> High Frequency Trading as an example

SOCIETY OF AGENTIC AIs
- These AIs have very clear ultimate objectives, but 
- Over time they progressively gain broader prevue to pursue these goals.
	- Those leviathan that successfully grow the range of areas where they can effectively pursue their agenda will be at decisive advantage.
	  Any agent able to operate w/o opposition gains the lion-share of all advantage possible from the new area, until others arrive.
	- This guarantees an arms race in expanding the reach of ones leviathan.
