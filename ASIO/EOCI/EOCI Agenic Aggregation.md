The principle of ***agentic aggregation*** states that certain broad classes of agents to a first order of approximation are overridingly driven towards aggregation of wealth or power.  In particular we argue that corporate-like entities and nation-states both behave in this way.


An **aggregation agent** is one whose overriding objective is achieving the highest possible rate of aggregation.

It should be noted that to a first order of approximation a capital aggregator pursues its goal despite arbitrary detriment to the parts of the aggregator itself and the system as a whole.  This includes:
- will of the leader
- damage to contributors
- damage to the ecosystem


Secondarily agentic aggregation indicates a propensity towards the merging of aggegators into singular aggregator


A Nation State Aggregator


The Regulatory Exception - nation-states can accept regulations that limit their own wealth/power and the wealth/power of others if the need is great enough.  In this case of AGI apocalypse there are reasons to expect this path may quite possibly be impossible.

A sufficiently large amount of centrally controlled capital (CCC) within a market system can be viewed as an entity whose overriding goal is to maximized the accumulation of more capital.  This capital aggregation system involves the capital itself, executive control over that capital and the system itself, human labor, physical resources, IP, 



- RESISTANCE - Corporations are extremely resistant to any force that would limit their ROI.

- many forms of end run

- AGI will offer, once in a generation, opportunities to disrupt and own

- Like a heroin addict no amount of reasoning will all them to escape the gravitational pull that they know will destroy themselves.
- Like the addict they will knowingly continue even in the face of certain destruction
- Like the heroin addict they will not know the exact action that tipped them over the point of no return, but it wont really matter since the outcome has long been a foregone conclusion.

- We will not stop AGI advancement even in the face of certainty of outcome, because of diffusion of responsibility
