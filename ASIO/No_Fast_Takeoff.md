Here, we argue why a unilateral fast take-off scenario might be less likely while risks from a slow takeoff might be greater than often considered.



Why a Corp-AI takeoff is likely and a notable risk for Humanity.


- Humanity sometimes provides notable benefits to citizens in need but generally allocates few resources across national boundaries.  Non-strategic aid across borders is consistently below 1% of GDP.
- Further, corporations are adept at moving their profits to locations with the greatest efficiency.  This will be even more true of a corporation that is not strongly constrained by either its workforce or its customer base.
- Thus, Corp-AIs emerging in the present world order will increase the value of capital relative to the value of labor
