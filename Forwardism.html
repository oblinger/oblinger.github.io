<h1 id="forwardism">Forwardism</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Those who call for the end of capitalism and the current world order
would do well to deeply understand an love the many incredible benefits
capitalism has brought to humanity. We literally cannot LIVE without
many of these benefits. Simply over throwing the current system would
yield chaos and widespread death as the many needs of the 8 BILLIONS
humans on earth would not be met is a gruesome mad-max, hunger-games
kind of way.</p>
<p>Still with this tribute in place, we are going to let’s call it like
we see it: capitalism has an evil seed buried right in its very center.
This evil pervades and perverts all aspects of the capital system. Here
we first identify this evil seed, and then go on to try to envision a
system that weaves benefits from many systems use today into a system
ejects this evil seen from its core:</p>
<h2 id="the-promise-and-perils-of-capitalism">The promise and perils of
capitalism</h2>
<p>POST CAPITALISM - CAPITALISM - Modern corporations have a fiduciary
duty to legally maximize shareholder value. - Additional considerations
(like benefit to the employee or society) only have value to the extent
that they somehow indirectly benefit shareholder value.<br />
- Capitalism slaves assets and labor for solve benefit of capital
itself. - According to modern corporate theory, the board of directors
has a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value. - Shareholder value
(and applicable laws) reigns supreme as the sole and ultimate arbiter of
“correct” action. - Capitalism seeks to enslave labor in service of
slave to capital. - Capitalism slaves both assets and labor in the sole
pursuit of maximizing the concentration of that capital. - Capitalism
enslaves labor to capital in pursuit of increased capital. - Capitalism
seeks to slave both assets and labor to capital in pursuit of increased
capital.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sustainable Differentiation -</p></li>
<li><p>FORWARDISM</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeks to maximize the number successful entrepreneurs (member
beneficiaries), while minimizing the number who fail in the
attempt.</li>
<li>Seeks to maximize the number of self sustaining, thriving
participants, while minimizing the number who fail in the attempt.</li>
<li>Like capitalism it is a self-amplifying system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>RETAINS MANY ADVANTAGES OF PRIOR SYSTEMS: Entitlements, Unions,
Corporations, Market Systems - SELF-AMPLIFYING - Capitalism is a
self-amplifying system. This is critical for any system seeking
humanity-scale change, the funds needed for any such endevor must come
from the change itself. No other source can scale with the problem being
tackled. - SELF-CORRECTING - - BOTTOM-UP DECENTRALIZED - - MAXIMIZES - -
COLLECTIVE - Builds upon notions of collective action underlying labor
unions, but forwardism seeks benefit to leverage that collective power
in - ENTITLEMENTS - Like entitlements, forwardism seeks to provide
benefit to ever larger numbers of beneficaries. - OWNERSHIP / -
EMPOWERMENT</p>
